# `realtime-counter`
This is a practice project that I decided to do where users can connect and increment a counter synchronously with eachother.

## How to use:
Prerequisites
- Git
- NodeJS
- Yarn

1. Run `git clone github.com/henrikvtcodes/realtime-counter.git` to download the source code. Use `degit` if you prefer.
2. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Start the server: `yarn run start`

## How does it work?
